swing-text-console
==================

## Original README

A Java Swing component which behaves like text console (with colors enabled).

Set of Java Swing components and backing business classes which
together behave like text console with enabled colors. The main idea
is to 'embed' such a component in a Swing application and then use the
'console' to perform various console tasks.

The console component can easily be extended to support different
types of console. Refer to the demo included with the sources for
simple induction on how to use the components.
